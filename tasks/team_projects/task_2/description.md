Hi! In my Team Projects page, please update four tasks in the Tasks database that are (or should be) part of the project “Publish support knowledge base”.
	1.	First, rename them with more descriptive titles:
	•	Task A → “Draft initial content outline”
	•	Task B → “Gather most common user questions”
	•	Task C → “Organize support topics by category”
	•	Task D → “Review existing help documentation”
	2.	Then, please make sure that all four of these tasks are included under the project “Publish support knowledge base” in the Projects database.

You don’t need to update any other fields like Assigned or Due. Thanks!
