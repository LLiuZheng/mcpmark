On my habit tracker page, please create a new four-column table block just below the main tracker to serve as a weekly summary of my habits.

The table should have the following headers:
	•	Habit name
	•	# of days completed (how many days the habit was checked off this week)
	•	Status (use the same logic as in the main tracker: Barely started, Making progress, or Crushing it)
	•	Missed completely? (Yes/No)

Please populate the table using data from the current week (Monday through Sunday), and fill in all values as plain text — no formulas or database references needed. No specific sorting is required.
