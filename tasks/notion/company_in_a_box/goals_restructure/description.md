Please restructure the **Current Goals** section on my **Company In A Box** page as follows:

1. **Add a new goal heading** — create a new `heading_3` block titled:
   
   `🔄 Digital Transformation Initiative`

2. **Convert all four goal headings to toggles** — the three existing goals
   * ⚙️ Expand Operations to LATAM  
   * 🛠️ Push for Enterprise  
   * 🩶 Boost Employee Engagement  
   * 🔄 Digital Transformation Initiative  

3. **Move descriptions inside the toggles** — every paragraph or list that originally sat directly under a goal heading should become a **child block** of that heading after it is made toggleable.

4. **Preserve content & order** — apart from the changes above, do **not** modify the text, formatting, or order of existing goal descriptions.

The end result should be a clean **Current Goals** section containing four toggleable goal headings, each with its corresponding details tucked inside.
