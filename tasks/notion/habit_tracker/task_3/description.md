On my habit tracker page, please create a new four-column table block just below the main tracker to serve as a weekly summary of my habits.

The table should have the following headers:
- **Habit name**
- **# of days completed** (how many days the habit was checked off this week)
- **Status** (determined as follows:  
  ‣ *Barely started* for 0–2 completions  
  ‣ *Making progress* for 3–5 completions  
  ‣ *Crushing it* for 6 or more completions)
- **Missed completely?** (Yes if the habit was never checked off this week, No otherwise)

Please populate the table using data from the current week (Monday through Sunday), and fill in all values as plain text — no formulas or database references needed. No specific sorting is required.
