Go to my Self Assessment page, and then create a hyperfocus analysis report by analyzing sessions with high productivity but significant challenges.

**Task Requirements:**
1. Create a new page titled "Hyperfocus Analysis Report" as a child of the Self Assessment page. The new page should be located between 'Why Use the Term "Hyperfocus"?' callout and the following divider line.
2. Query the "Hyperfocus Self-Assessment Worksheet" database to find all sessions where:
   - Work Completion Rate is greater than 80% (0.8)
   - At least one challenge is present in the Challenges field
3. For each qualifying session, create a section with:
   - A heading showing the date and activity type (format: YYYY-MM-DD Activity)
   - A bullet list containing:
     - Focus factors used (e.g., Focus factors: XXX, YYY)
     - Energy level and mood (format: "Energy: X/10, Mood: Y/10")
     - Challenges faced (e.g., Challenges: XXX, YYY)
     - Strategies that helped overcome challenges (e.g., Strategies: XXX, YYY)
     - Work completion rate (format: "Completion: XX%")
4. At the top of the page, add a callout block (type: "info") with:
   - Title: "Top 2 Most Effective Strategies"
   - Content: List the 2 most frequently used strategies from all sessions, each on a new line with format "â€¢ Strategy Name (used in X sessions)"

**Structure Requirements:**
- The page must have the exact title "Hyperfocus Analysis Report"
- Each session section must start with a level 2 heading
- All session details must be in bullet point format
- The summary callout must be at the top of the page before any session details
