Your goal is to create a new study-session entry in the **Computer Science Student Dashboard** page.

1. Locate the ☑️ Habit tracker section of the page.
2. **Insert a new date section** immediately **after the existing `2022-09-02` to-do items but *before* the divider block** that follows them. Make sure the new date has proper formatting with a date mention and bold styling like the existing dates, and all to-do items should be unchecked initially. The new section should be inserted right after the 2022-09-02 to-do items but before the divider.
3. Directly **beneath** this new date mention, add **exactly four unchecked to-do blocks** with the following plain text (including the leading emoji on each line):
   • 🧠 Review algorithms for technical interview
   • 📚 Study database systems chapter 7
   • ⚡ Practice system design problems
   • 🎯 Complete data structures assignment
