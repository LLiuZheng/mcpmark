Please update the "Languages" section on my resume page (titled "Maya Zhang") to include Chinese, since I can now speak it fluently. Please also add the corresponding national flag emoji next to it, matching the style of the existing English and Portuguese entries. The entry should be placed between English and Portuguese.
