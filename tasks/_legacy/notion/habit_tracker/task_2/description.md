On my habit tracker page, please add a new property to the tracker table called “status”, which reflects how consistently each habit is completed during the week.

Use the following custom labels based on how many days the habit is checked:
	•	“Barely started” for 0–2 completions
	•	“Making progress” for 3–5 completions
	•	“Crushing it” for 6 or more

These should replace the default status values like “Not started”, “In progress”, and “Done” to better match habit tracking goals.
