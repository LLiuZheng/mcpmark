Hi! In my Team Projects page, please first create the following six new tasks in the Tasks database:
	•	“Study fundamentals of reinforcement learning”
	•	“Explore architectures of LLM-based agents”
	•	“Research existing training pipelines for RL”
	•	“Compare distributed training frameworks for large models”
	•	“Build training infrastructure for agentic RL”
	•	“Train a prototype agent using the new pipeline”

Then, create two new projects in the Projects database.

The first project should be titled “Foundations of RL and LLM Agents”, with a timeline from March 24, 2025 to May 1, 2025, and priority P0. It should include the two tasks related to learning RL and LLM agent concepts, and be assigned an Eng Hours estimate of 500. This project should block the second project.

The second project should be titled “Infrastructure for LLM + RL Training”, with a timeline from May 4, 2025 to May 28, 2025, and priority P1. It should include the four tasks related to infrastructure and model training, and be assigned 800 Eng Hours. It should also be blocked by the first project.

Finally, please create a new Project Type titled “Train an agentic RL model”, and group both projects under it.

Thanks!
